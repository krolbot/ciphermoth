"""
Clear answers for clients of the vault key protocol that v1.6.0 removed.

v1.4.x clients unlocked with ``POST /master_password/check``, received the vault
key and sent it back in the ``x-ciphermoth-key-derivation`` header. Neither is
accepted any more. Both are answered here, before routing, so the key is never
derived for them and a request carrying the header never reaches a route,
whatever else it carries. The 403 uses the ``invalid_key`` code because that is
what makes a v1.4.6 or v1.4.7 browser tab drop its key and reload into the
current web UI.
